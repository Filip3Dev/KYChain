## KYChain
 Smart alternative to traditional KYC modules 
 Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)

## Motivation
  The objectives of KYC guidelines is to prevent the data from banks or any such important organizations from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for any purposes.
Essentially, the KYC process involves collecting, tracking and storing huge amounts of data , so that it may be reported to regulatory agencies in a timely fashion.
Considering the service for banks, with the world virtually becoming boundary-free, cross-border banking transactions have grown by leaps and bounds. So has the need to ensure adequate security measure are in place.
In such a sitituion the Blockchain acts as an immutable distributed ledger shared in the public domain. Every participant interacts with the blockchain using a public-private cryptographic key combination.
